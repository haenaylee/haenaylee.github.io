Hi there, I'm Haena! I'm a mechanical engineer working to advance 'human-centered biomedical engineering.' I aim to develop equitable and accessible healthcare technologies that understand the needs of patients and clinicians to provide the most optimal personalized care.

For the past three years, I worked as a Research Engineer II in the <a href='https://www.hss.edu/biomechanics-research-staff.asp'>Department of Biomechanics</a> at the Hospital for Special Surgery in NYC. Prior to that, I graduated from Cornell University with a B.S. and M.Eng in Mechanical Engineering.

My main technical skills include computational methods (CAD, FEA, CFD, ML, programming) and experimental methods (motion capture, mechanical testing, fabrication, manufacturing). I'm also a decent public speaker.

Outside of work, I love to <a href='https://www.librarything.com/catalog/haenaylee'>read</a>, <a href='projects/drawing'>draw</a>, play video games, and take care of my two cats and 70+ plants. I'm also constantly thinking of creative ways to design and renovate my living spaces. My long-term dreams include creating schools in rural areas, creating a cat sanctuary with my mom, and operating a vintage coffee/book/flower shop as a safe space for people in my community.

I would love to connect with you and hear your story. The best way to reach me is by email at <a href="mailto:hylee2716@gmail.com">hylee2716@gmail.com</a>.

_My name: First name is Haena-Young ("HAN-nah young"), last name is Lee, and I go by Haena. It is Romanized Korean and means 'the warm spirit of the rising sun.'_ ðŸŒ…
