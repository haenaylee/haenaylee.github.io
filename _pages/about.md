Hi there! I'm a mechanical engineer working to advance **'human-centered biomedical engineering**.**'** I aim to develop equitable and accessible healthcare technologies that understand the needs of patients and clinicians to provide the most optimal and personalized care. My main technical skills include computational modeling, coding, and experimental testing. I'm also a decent public speaker (or so they say...).

For the past three years, I worked as a Research Engineer II in the <a href='https://www.hss.edu/biomechanics-research-staff.asp'>Department of Biomechanics</a> at the Hospital for Special Surgery in NYC. Prior to that, I graduated from Cornell University with a B.S. and M.Eng in Mechanical Engineering.

Outside of work, I love to <a href='https://www.librarything.com/catalog/haenaylee'>read</a>, <a href='projects/drawing'>draw</a>, play video games, and take care of my two cats and 70+ plants. I'm also constantly thinking of creative ways to design and renovate living spaces. My long-term dreams include creating a school in a rural area, a cat sanctuary with my mom, and a vintage coffee/book/flower shop as a safe space for people in my community.

I would love to connect with you and hear your story! The best way to reach me is by email at <a href="mailto:hylee2716@gmail.com">hylee2716@gmail.com</a>.

_My name: My first name is Haena-Young ("HAN-nah young"), last name is Lee, and I go by Haena. It is Romanized Korean and means 'the warm spirit of the rising sun.'_ ðŸŒ…

A graphical representation of various research topics that I am interested in within 'human-centered biomedical engineering.' Each one of these is an entire field in and of itself, so I hope to study a few of them in depth before potentially exploring the others.
