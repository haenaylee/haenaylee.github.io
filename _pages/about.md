I'm a mechanical engineer working to advance "human-centered biomedical engineering." I aim to develop equitable and accessible healthcare technologies that understand the needs of patients and clinicians to provide the most optimal personalized care.

I worked as a Research Engineer II in the <a href='https://www.hss.edu/biomechanics-research-staff.asp'>Department of Biomechanics</a> at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City for over three years. Prior to that, I graduated from Cornell University with a B.S. and M.Eng in Mechanical Engineering.

My main technical skills include computational methods (CAD, FEA, CFD, ML, programming) and experimental methods (motion capture, fabrication & manufacturing). I'm also a great public speaker.

Outside of work, I love to read, try my best to replicate the art of Renaissance drawings, play video games, and take care of my two cats and 70+ plants. I'm also constantly thinking of creative ways to design and renovate my living spaces. My long-term dreams include creating schools in rural areas, creating a cat sanctuary with my mom, and owning a vintage, jazzy coffee/book/flower shop that is a safe space for people in my community.

The best way to reach me is by email at <a href="mailto:hylee2716@gmail.com">hylee2716@gmail.com</a>.
