I'm a mechanical engineer interested in advancing what I consider "human-centered biomedical engineering." 

I worked as a Research Engineer II in the <a href='https://www.hss.edu/biomechanics-research-staff.asp'>Department of Biomechanics</a> at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City for over three years. Prior to that, I graduated from Cornell University with a B.S. and M.Eng in Mechanical Engineering.

My research interests include .
My main technical skills include computational methods (CAD, FEA, CFD, ML, programming) and experimental methods (motion capture, fabrication & manufacturing). I'm also a great public speaker.

Outside of work, I love to read, try my best to replicate the art of Renaissance drawings, play video games, and take care of my two cats and 70+ plants. I'm hoping to learn muay thai and electric guitar too! I also enjoy constantly thinking of creative ways to renovate my living spaces. My long-term dreams include creating schools in rural areas and cat rescue
owning a vintage, jazzy coffee/book/flower shop that can feel like a safe space for people in my community.
