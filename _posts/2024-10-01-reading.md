I would love to share some of my reading recommendations with you. These texts have shaped me in one way or another, challenging my pre-existing mindsets and notions about our relationships and the world around us. You can also check out the books I've recently read or am currently reading <a href='https://www.librarything.com/catalog/haenaylee'>here</a>.

I'm a serial quote collector - quotes and thoughts on these works coming soon.
