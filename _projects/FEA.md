<h3>First study</h3>

    One of the most difficult complications to address in revision total hip arthroplasties is large bone loss in the pelvis. Due to the size and variability of the defects, it is hard to use conventional, off-the-shelf implants.

    Patient-specific flanged acetabular components (FACs) are designed for such complex cases. However, it is difficult to determine the optimal combination of design and surgical decisions because there are many parameters at play.

    We aimed to build a novel finite element (FE) model that can predict the location and method of implant failure by determining the biomechanical effects of different variables. We chose a representative patient,
