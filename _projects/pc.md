During my MEng (and the pandemic!), I created a PC to see if I could train my machine learning model on an NVIDIA GPU.
This was a very fun project through which I learned the basics of computer hardware assembly and software installation. I am by no means an expert, so I hope to continue learning more about computers through these kinds of projects.
My next goal is to make an updated version with water cooling.

I want to acknowledge that this would not have been possible without my parents' financial support. I am so grateful to have had the privilege to be able to pursue this project thanks to my lovely parents.
