After my first job out of college, I've been thinking a lot about what kind of life or career might make me happy. I thought about the things that sparked me as a kid and began to reintroduce them back into my life, hoping they might point me in the right directions.

English and art were the subjects I were effortlessly good at as a kid. From elementary to high school, I would  consistently write ten pages for a one page prompt, or spend every lunch and recess in the art classroom perfecting my sculptures. I lost touch with my creative side while I was focusing on becoming an engineer, but I am beyond thrilled to revisit it as an adult. Despite the loss of a child's wild imagination, in its stead is an extraordinary sense of artistic and financial freedom.

My goal is to practice the Renaissance-era style of drawing (and perhaps painting) until I can bring a particular vision of mine to life. It will be my way of acknowledging and grappling with the magnitude of suffering in the world. But I have yet to take classes so I have a long, exciting way to go!

I commissioned a local woodworker for a lovely desk to house all my art supplies - pictures coming soon.
