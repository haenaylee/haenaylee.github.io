When I graduated from my STEM Magnet high school, I had regrets about how I had strategized going through high school and preparing for college applications.
I thought that if I were to go through the process again, I would have a lot of advice that I could give to myself.
<br><br>So I wrote a guide on my experience through high school and the college application process in the hopes that other young students might be able to be more informed and prepare themselves well for the academic journey.
<br>
<br>The book covers everything from statistics to stereotypes - the structure of the school programs, the resources offered, student life, etc.
It also includes other students' experiences and a lot of heartfelt advice from yours truly.
<br><br>You can check out the book on Amazon or Kindle <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Blair-Book-insiders-Montgomery-application/dp/1983270881'>here</a> and Apple Books (formerly iBooks) <a href='https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-blair-book/id1155953913?ls=1'>here</a>. I'm always happy to give you a free copy, just send me an email.
