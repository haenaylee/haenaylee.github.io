  abstract={Patient-specific flanged acetabular components are utilized to treat failed total hip arthroplasties with large acetabular defects. Previous clinical studies from our institution showed that these implants tend to lateralize the acetabular center of rotation. However, the clinical impact of lateralization on implant survivorship is debated. Our goal was to develop a finite element model to quantify how lateralization of the native hip center affects periprosthetic strain and implant-bone micromotion distributions in a static level gait loading condition. To build the model, we computationally created a superomedial acetabular defect in a computed tomography 3D reconstruction of a native pelvis and designed a flanged acetabular implant to address this simulated bone defect. We modeled two implants, one with ~1 cm and a second with ~2 cm of hip center lateralization. We applied the maximum hip contact force and corresponding abductor force observed during level gait. The resulting strains were compared to bone fatigue strength (0.3% strain) and the micromotions were compared to the threshold for bone ingrowth (20 µm). Overall, the model demonstrated that the additional lateralization only slightly increased the area of bone at risk of failure and decreased the areas compatible with bone ingrowth. This computational study of patient-specific acetabular implants establishes the utility of our modeling approach. Further refinement will yield a model that can explore a multitude of variables and could be used to develop a biomechanically-based acetabular bone loss classification system to guide the development of patient-specific implants in the treatment of large acetabular bone defects.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
